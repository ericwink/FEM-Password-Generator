## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

This exercise allowed me to practice better problem solving techniques. Breaking down a large problem into smaller components, solving those and connecting the dots.

### Useful resources

- [Range Style Selector](http://danielstern.ca/range.css/?ref=css-tricks#/) - This tool by Daniel Stern is a much easier way to style a range input, which can be cumbersome to do from scratch.
